# Lisaaniyat: Studying Arabic speech in motion

## Executive Summary

### Arabic has long had a reputation of being articulatorily 'special'. It features speech sounds that are crosslinguistically
rare; Arabic is one of only a handful of languages in the world that uses sounds produced
using the pharynx, a ring of muscles at the back of the throat. Even fewer languages (only three attested in
the world) have both pharyngeal sounds and other unique sounds produced between the teeth (such as
'th'). Thus, Arabic is spoken using sounds produced from the very back of the throat to the very front of
the mouth, utilizing the whole of the vocal tract. Mastering Arabic pronunciation is notoriously difficult,
with second language learners and even native speakers self-reporting difficulty in acquisition. Despite
this, comprehensive studies which document the acoustic features and the configuration of articulators
(organs used to produce speech) for Arabic are in their infancy. The proposed work employs real-time
magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) with simultaneous audio recording, in which speakers speak inside
an MRI to produce high-quality sagittal (side view) images of the vocal tract and to produce acoustically
matched recordings of said speech. It also includes descriptions of the configuration of the articulatory
system during pronunciation of Arabic speech sounds as well as phonetic annotations of audio recordings.
Speech sounds of both Modern Standard Arabic and an international collection of dialects will be
collected and described in phonetic detail with accompanying videos, images, and methodological notes
concerning optimization of image capture from real-time speech. In addition to pioneering state-of-the-art
methods of producing frame-by-frame MRI images of speech and for filtering acoustic recordings from
inside an MRI, the goals of the proposed work are two-fold: First, the created resource will serve as a
database that various social science and related researchers, including researchers of linguistics, natural
language processing, speech language pathology, automatic speech recognition, and so forth, can access
for the purposes of searching and analyzing high quality, annotated data of how people speak Arabic.
Second, the resource will also function as an educational tool for the acquisition and/or improvement of
Arabic pronunciation by native and non-native speakers.
